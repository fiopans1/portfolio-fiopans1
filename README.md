## ✨ Description

This is the **personal portfolio of fiopans1**, a project designed to showcase my skills, background, and featured projects in web development.  
While initially inspired by [Soumyajit Behera's portfolio](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio), this version was **completely rebuilt, modernized, and personalized** through:

- Upgrade to **React 19** and a modern development toolset.
- Migration to **Vite** for faster development and better performance.
- Full visual redesign and complete code refactor.
- Implementation of **new technologies** and **modern libraries**.
- Complete adaptation to the **latest versions** of React Bootstrap and other dependencies.

The result is a **unique, personalized, and fully updated** portfolio aligned with the best current frontend development practices.
